##1.  Description :page_with_curl:

The Hair Projekt(THP) is a web application by which registered users can post and share their most recent haircut/styling experience. Finding the right barber/hairdresser can be a hassle sometimes, THP helps users narrow down their choices and assists them in making a decision as the user has a better overall view of the respective salon. They can view posts containing the price, location, barber/hairdresser name, and overall experience from other users.

##2.  Wireframes :pencil:

Please view our Trello board below :wink:

##3.  Technologies :iphone:

Technologies used to build this app include: Ruby on Rails(v2.3.1), HTML, CSS and AJAX. In addition, PostgreSQL was used in the formation of the database. Trello was used for our group project management and workflow assistance. Heroku is being used as a cloud platform to host our application (below). GoogleMaps API was included to assist out location base functionality (location auto complete and mode of travel/distance)

##4. Deployment :gemini:

We used Heroku as our deployment platform. We then followed the guideline created by the legendary HMAN1911 :smirk:

##5.  Installation/Startup Instructions :book:

https://thehairprojekt.herokuapp.com

Direct your browser by clicking on the application URL above and load the page.

* As a user you can log in and log out of the website. If you are not a user, create your account by clicking the 'sign up' button
* Once you are a user you can post a review about your recent hair cut in which you can upload 3 photos(Front Back Side), add shop name/location of hair salon, Stylist name, Price (stars/5). The app will automatically map out your distance between your current location and the hair salon. This functionality keeps you, the user within the app instead of you going out of it to use GoogleMaps.
* As a user you can add comments on other posts
* As a user you can bookmark/like your favourite/potential hair cut on the site, which will then be listed in your favourites
* As a user you can delete comments/posts you have created
